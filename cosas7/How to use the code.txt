This project is made with a simple own 2D motor.
To use it, is required previous expirience with C++ and SDL.

The motor is structured using an App made from diferents modules.
Through SDL window, render, input and audio are managed. Physics is managed with Box2D.
The motor supports isometric and orthogonal maps. It has a pathfinding module, an entities manger and 
a simple GUI sistem. To ease the use of the external files a Virtual file system is included and 
PugiXML is used to manage XML files for maps, saves and configurations.

The actual project, is more simple and does not need to use all the motor modules (map, pathfinding and physics
are not used). 
To create more modules, a base class module is created. Add them to the App module list whom will call them
automatically. Take in account the order of these modules need to draw. Some basic draw modules are included
with that version of the motor. The same way, entities and gui have base class defined for improvements or 
create more elements.
The scenes have a manager and a base class to create as much as needed. On the project specifically, we use two scenes
the intro and the level one. Levels are loaded from specific classes created for that.
